# AgencyOS canonical deltas

**Protocol:** [CANONICAL-STATE-PROTOCOL.md](CANONICAL-STATE-PROTOCOL.md)

The ledger of candidate changes to canonical state.

- **Entries are append-only.** An entry is never edited to change what it said, and never deleted.
- **Rejected deltas stay recorded**, with the reason.
- **A published correction never deletes an earlier entry.** It is a new entry that points at the
  entry it corrects.
- **This ledger does not itself override [`CURRENT-STATE.md`](CURRENT-STATE.md).** A delta is
  `PUBLISHED` only when it is also reflected there and the other publication conditions hold
  (protocol section 8).

The first delta recorded under this protocol is `DELTA-20260928-001` (under *Entries* below).
State changes before it are recorded in the prior durable sources the protocol names; they are not
reconstructed here.

## DELTA-20260928-001

Status: ACCEPTED

Detected: 2026-09-28T22:18:49Z

Published: Pending

Sources:
- `docs/control-room/CANONICAL-STATE-PROTOCOL.md` (published at `1d4c136`).
- `docs/control-room/DECISIONS.md`: `DECISION-20260928-001` to `-004`, migrated in this delta.
- `docs/reviews/AGENCYOS-CANONICAL-CLOSURE-STATE.md`: the operational-closure authority, sections
  1, 3, 6, 9 and 11.
- Build-97 product commit `b3f41bfd68e81ab42da899671f58e01f0988d3d2`, tag `alpha-b3f41bf`.
- The Control Room's pre-protocol NG-1, NG-2 and NG-3 adjudications and the Owner's NG-OD1
  approval, all of 2026-09-28. These are pre-protocol Control Room and Owner provenance, carried
  into this repository through the Control Room's Phase 2A migration instruction. No conversation
  transcript is a repository source, and none is cited as one.

Prior claim: `docs/control-room/CURRENT-STATE.md` is a `BOOTSTRAP PENDING` shell and holds no
substantive next-generation current state. `DECISIONS.md` holds no decisions.

Candidate/new claim: The durable current-state candidate records:
- the released product identity (ALPHA 0.1.0 build 97);
- terminal operational closure;
- NG-1, NG-2 and NG-3 as closed;
- the four governing decision records;
- NG-4 as the exact next bounded architecture stage.

Claimed transition: BOOTSTRAP PENDING → complete migration candidate; publication pending.

Scope: Canonical-state migration only. No product behaviour and no architecture decision is newly
made by this delta. It records decisions already made and state already established.

Evidence:
- **Machine-verifiable facts**, re-verified on 2026-09-28 at detection:
  - tag `alpha-b3f41bf` is annotated object `3219b226f709c7dd784c6af52ce4869263a50085` and
    dereferences to `b3f41bf`, locally and on `origin`;
  - CI run `36404049885` (#109, `workflow_dispatch`) and Nightly run `36427576682` (#58,
    `workflow_dispatch`) both succeeded on exactly `b3f41bf`;
  - `ApiContract.Current = 17` and the migration `20260909072201_AiResultClassification` are
    present at `b3f41bf`;
  - the build-97 release record carries the EXE SHA-256 recorded in the closure state;
  - every path changed in `b3f41bf..1d4c136` is under `docs/`.
- **Control Room adjudications**: NG-1, NG-2 (NG-2A and NG-2B) and NG-3, recorded as
  `DECISION-20260928-001`, `-003` and `-004`.
- **Owner decision**: the represented-subject family (NG-OD1), recorded as
  `DECISION-20260928-002`.
- **Evidence level**: the architecture decisions rest on source inspection of Build 97 and bounded
  cross-vertical falsification. They are design adjudications, not implementation or operator
  evidence.

Conflicts: None after applying scoped canonical precedence. Two points are recorded, not erased:
- Older seed and update files, including the Control Room Project bootstrap sources outside the
  repository and the pre-closure release and review records the closure state lists in its
  section 13, contain stale states. They are historical, and they lose to the closure state and
  to this migration for the present.
- The closure state's section 11 says "None pending". That is scoped to operational closure, and
  still holds. The same section says next-generation work needs its own explicit authorization;
  naming NG-4 as the next bounded action does not itself begin or authorize NG-4 work.

Authority required:
- machine-verifiable fact, for the repository and release identity;
- `CONTROL_ROOM`, for the migration and for the adjudicated architecture state;
- `OWNER`, as the source decision for the represented-subject family (already given; not asked
  for again here).

Adjudication: The Control Room accepted this migration for drafting in its Phase 2A instruction,
with the decision texts, IDs and current-state content specified there. This exact candidate is
submitted to the Control Room for inspection before publication.

What changes if accepted: Once publication completes (protocol section 8, and the receipt sealing
in `DECISIONS.md`), the candidate `CURRENT-STATE.md` and the four decision entries become the
durable bootstrap state.

Supersedes: The `BOOTSTRAP PENDING` shell content of `CURRENT-STATE.md`. No earlier delta or
decision.

Unchanged:
- The released product remains ALPHA 0.1.0 build 97 (`b3f41bf`).
- Operational closure remains terminal.
- No product implementation.
- `docs/reviews/AGENCYOS-CANONICAL-CLOSURE-STATE.md` keeps its governed scope, including D1–D5,
  Decision C, the C12/C14 residual acceptance and the C1–C16 register, none of which is duplicated
  here.
- The open architecture questions remain open.

Open / unresolved questions: The open-question groups in `CURRENT-STATE.md`: representation,
subject identity and reference, commercial, and vertical architecture (the NG-4 extension
mechanism).

Forbidden implications: This migration does **not**:
- re-prove operational closure;
- begin NG-4;
- authorize implementation, schema, API or domain changes;
- make the candidate state `PUBLISHED` before the publication protocol completes.

Publication receipt: Pending
